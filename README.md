## Codes

### EX_OK (0)
successful termination


### EX__BASE (64)
base value for error messages


### EX_USAGE (64)
The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the
wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax
in a parameter, or whatever.


### EX_DATAERR (65)
The input data was incorrect in some way.  This
should only be used for user's data and not system
files.


### EX_NOINPUT (66)
An input file (not a system file) did not exist or
was not readable.  This could also include errors
like ``No message'' to a mailer (if it cared to
catch it).


### EX_NOUSER (67)
The user specified did not exist.  This might be
used for mail addresses or remote logins.


### EX_NOHOST (68)
The host specified did not exist.  This is used in
mail addresses or network requests.


### EX_UNAVAILABLE (69)
A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a sup足
port program or file does not exist.  This can also
be used as a catchall message when something you
wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.


### EX_SOFTWARE (70)
An internal software error has been detected.  This
should be limited to non-operating system related
errors as possible.


### EX_OSERR (71)
An operating system error has been detected.  This
is intended to be used for such things as ``cannot
fork'', ``cannot create pipe'', or the like.  It
includes things like getuid returning a user that
does not exist in the passwd file.


### EX_OSFILE (72)
Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp,
etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
sort of error (e.g., syntax error).


### EX_CANTCREAT (73)
A (user specified) output file cannot be created.


### EX_IOERR (74)
An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.


### EX_TEMPFAIL (75)
Temporary failure, indicating something that is not
really an error.  In sendmail, this means that a
mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection, and
the request should be reattempted later.


### EX_PROTOCOL (76)
The remote system returned something that was ``not
possible'' during a protocol exchange.


### EX_NOPERM (77)
You did not have sufficient permission to perform
the operation.  This is not intended for file sys足
tem problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or
EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permis足
sions.


### EX_CONFIG (78)
Something was found in an unconfigured or miscon足
figured state.


### EX__MAX (78)
maximum listed value
